    "content": "FRANKFURT, Germany \u2014 German exports picked up in March but industrial orders fell unexpectedly, official data showed Tuesday, reflecting a mixed picture for Europe\u2019s biggest economy.Exports rose by 0.9 percent month-on-month after a decline of 1.6 percent in February, federal statistics agency Destatis said, defying expectations of a continued downward trend.But new orders, closely watched as an indicator of future business activity, fell by 0.4 percent month-on-month.Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected a rise of 0.45 percent.ING bank analyst Carsten Brzeski said the figures published Tuesday confirmed \u201cthe return of the export-driven German growth model\u201d.READ: German exports lose momentum in FebruaryHowever, the weak industrial orders \u201cspoiled the party of optimism\u201d, he said, illustrating \u201cthe high risk that the revival of the export-oriented success formula is only short-lived\u201d.March orders were propped up by strong demand from the eurozone, but domestic orders fell by 3.6 percent and those from the rest of the world were down by 2.9 percent.Exports to the European Union rose by 0.5 percent compared with February, and those to the rest of the world also increased by 1.3 percent.Imports to Germany meanwhile were up by 0.3 percent month-on-month in March, with the country\u2019s trade surplus coming in at 22.3 billion euros.High inflation, costly energy, and weaker demand from key market China have weighed heavily on Germany\u2019s key manufacturing sector in recent months.READ: German industrial output fell more than expected in DecemberHowever, an expected recovery in domestic and foreign demand will mean that \u201cincoming orders are expected to trend upwards again as the year progresses\u201d, the economy ministry said in a statement.The German government slightly increased its 2024 growth forecast in April to 0.3 percent, up from a previous prediction of 0.2 percent.The German economy grew by 0.2 percent in the first quarter of the year, dodging a recession after a weak end to 2023.",

    "content": "Allen Dizon (left) and Laurice Guillen\u2013JAY ALTAREJOSIndie filmmaker Jay Altarejos is organizing a limited release for \u201cGuardia de Honor\u201d in the Philippines \u201cto provide our fellow Filipinos with the opportunity to experience the film that resonated with Russian cineastes and was enjoyed by our compatriots in Russia,\u201d he said.The tragic drama, starring Laurice Guillen, Sunshine Cruz and Therese Malvar, had its world premiere at the 2024 Moscow International Film Festival in Russia, which ran from April 19 to 26. It is all about \u201cthe emancipation of womanhood,\u201d according to Altarejos, who also wrote and edited it.Altarejos said there were some questions during the film\u2019s Q&A session in Moscow that he found interesting. \u201cFirst, they inquired about the choice of black and white for the film,\u201d he told Inquirer Entertainment. \u201cThe decision to present the film in black and white was driven by a desire to distill it to its essence, free from the potential distractions of color.\u201cAdditionally, it pays homage to the rich history of cinema, which originated in black and white. In a contemporary context, amid the advancements in filmmaking, it\u2019s poignant to recall the timeless sentiment: \u2018My life is cinema, black-and-white cinema.\u2019\u201dAltarejos recalled that there was also a question on the inclusion of a clip featuring the presidential inauguration of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. He explained, \u201cThe film depicts women overcoming patriarchy and misogyny, yet it also underscores the enduring influence of patriarchy within our society. This is evidenced by our collective history of oppression, reflected in the election of leaders like [Rodrigo] Duterte, emblematic of misogyny and patriarchy, and now Marcos Jr., son of a former dictator.\u201d\u201cGuardia de Honor\u201d is based on the story of an off duty policeman who shot dead at point-blank range his elderly female neighbor and her son in Paniqui, Tarlac, in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re organizing a limited release in the Philippines,\u201d said Altarejos.The film is set on the eve of the presidential inauguration, when the seemingly happy life of a middle class family is shattered after police officer Eddie Boy (Allen Dizon) gets arrested for killing the mother and her son.Altarejos considers his own mother the most influential woman in his life, even though he had a conflicted relationship with her. \u201cEven now that she\u2019s gone, I\u2019m still grappling with the memories\u2014whether they were pleasant or not\u2014but as I get older, the more I appreciate women and mothers. How are you able to manage? You conceive, go through those nine difficult months, raise your child and take all these in.\u201cI remember how she would react whenever I ended painful relationships. I was already an adult, so I resented her for that. But I guess a mother never ceases to be one, no matter how old her child becomes.\u201c\u2018Guardia de Honor\u2019 tells the stories of our women, because I\u2019m always moved by their strength and bravery. I still remember the songs she sang to us, her wanderlust. She wasn\u2019t meant to be in that place (Ticao Island in Masbate), and so she came to Manila and brought us with her. I also saw her independence. She was widowed at 46 and she had four kids to raise. She never left us, even if this meant defying our grandmother.\u201dTherese who plays Marie, Eddie Boy\u2019s timid daughter and granddaughter of Laurice\u2019s character Mamang Anita, had this to say when asked what lesson she wanted the audience to learn from her character. \u201cThere is hope even in the darkest situation, as long as you stick with each other and help one another. Also, try as hard as you can to break that generational curse. Just like in the movie, what happens within the family in real life sometimes becomes a vicious cycle. Be brave enough to break it.\u201dSunshine\u2019s character, Minda (Marie\u2019s aunt), lacks self-confidence and is afraid of Mamang. \u201cHave courage, speak up. You can\u2019t just keep hiding what you feel,\u201d Sunshine stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to sleep at night if you\u2019re carrying a heavy emotional baggage. That\u2019s what I always say even to my own daughters. \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it. We will all help in trying to fix it.\u2019 That\u2019s what I want to teach our audience. Communicating with family is very important.\u201dLaurice agreed with Therese about being brave enough to break the generational curse. \u201cAnita herself is just like Minda and Marie because she kept it all to herself,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou have to respect yourself, as well. If you don\u2019t because of fear, or because you seek approval, you might lose yourself in the process. The most important thing you should ask yourself is, \u2018Who am i really?\u2019 If you cannot answer that, then you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d INQ",

I\u2019m thankful that after being in this industry for 25 or 26 years, I\u2019m still doing what I love doing. I just wish for good health for myself and my loved ones, especially my dad. That\u2019s what will truly make me happy. Everything else is a bonus,\u201d the 39-year-old celebrity said at a recent launch of Avon\u2019s latest intimate apparels, #360ComfortBras.Heart said she does not simply agree to endorsing a product. It also has to be something she can relate to. \u201cSome people think that, because you present yourself in a certain way on Instagram, you\u2019re already perfect. Avon isn\u2019t just about the shape, but also a woman\u2019s personality; about owning your truth, embracing your flaws, forgiving yourself or being kind to yourself. I feel like it\u2019s the whole package. So when I was told that it\u2019s all about women empowerment, I felt that it was also something for myself, to encourage me to empower myself even more,\u201d she explained.The latest Avon campaign carries the theme, \u201cShape the World, Embrace Your Power,\u201d and Heart has this to say about it: \u201cIt simply means that, in your own little way, you can help the community around you. I may not be super famous, but whoever follows me hopefully learns from my story, from my life. What you see on my YouTube channel, or what I post on Instagram, will hopefully help shape people or give them a glimpse of hope. I don\u2019t have a perfect life. I try to be honest as much as I can, so with that, I hope to inspire them to just keep on going with their lives,\u201d said the wife of Sen. Francis Escudero.In another interview, Heart said she was pleasantly surprised that a lot of people tolerate her \u201ckaartehan\u201d (fussiness). This time, Heart explained what she meant: \u201cMay narating ang kaartehan ko: from my very first role as Missy in [the TV series] \u2018G-Mik\u2019 to Portia in [the movie] \u2018Tanging Ina.\u2019 Puro kakikayan ang alam ko, but because I try to be as authentic as possible, it is taking me to where I am, which is Fashion Week. I\u2019m just very grateful for that. I don\u2019t consider what I do now as a job\u2014it\u2019s what I love to do. The lesson here is that being authentic will take you somewhere. It\u2019s not easy, but I promise you, it will.\u201dHeart said she is determined to \u201cempower women with this body.\u201d She explained: \u201cI am considered \u2018very petite\u2019 in the world of fashion. But we\u2019re really made from different cuts, so, to me, it\u2019s all about embracing your imperfections and being comfortable with them. I hope that will be enough to help people boost their confidence.\u201dIn a recent Instagram reel, she is seen bonding and having fun with two women, wearing only a bra top. Heart was then asked how she was able to muster the confidence to shoot the video and post it on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s all about your experience in life. When I was younger, I was very hard on myself. As I got older, I sort of developed self-worth. I learned to love myself more, gain more confidence,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI feel like all of these make sense now. I am proud to be the woman I am today and this wouldn\u2019t have happened if I didn\u2019t go through life.\u201dShe continued: \u201cBeing confident is hard to do. I don\u2019t feel good about myself all the time, especially on social media. If you put yourself out there, you should be open to accepting all the comments, good or bad. But I feel immune to that already. I\u2019m stronger now. It\u2019s definitely empowering to use what I\u2019ve learned in my life to, in a sense, inspire and help other women.\u201dAsked to give her advice to women, Heart said: \u201cThis is also for those who do not feel at ease with who they are: It\u2019s alright. It\u2019s normal. But with a little more effort\u2014koting pitik, konting suntok, konting push\u2014you will be able to build your self-worth. You only need to love yourself and the rest will follow. And even if other people don\u2019t love you, it doesn\u2019t matter. If those around you love you, that\u2019s all you need.\u201d INQ",

    "content": "Seth Fedelin (left) and Francine Diaz, collectively known as \u201cFranSeth\u201d \u2014SETH FEDELIN/ INSTAGRAMIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d said Seth Fedelin when asked whether or not he and love-team partner Francine Diaz are already dating, five years after \u201cFranSeth\u201d was formed.\u201cI\u2019m being a gentleman, so I\u2019m answering the question now. It\u2019s possible for us to reach that level in the future, but we will soon be making our first movie, so that is our priority right now,\u201d Seth told reporters during a story conference organized by Regal Entertainment for their romantic drama \u201cMy Future You.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, dating is still far from my mind. I don\u2019t want to feel pressured to have a romantic relationship with Francine right now. First of all\u2014I always say this\u2014I respect her and her parents. I admit that Francine and I talk about this, but I will not elaborate. In time, we will be able to give a more definite answer to this particular question.\u201dFrancine agreed and added: \u201cI guess it will not diminish my being a woman if I say it\u2019s likely for Seth and me to end up together, especially because we still have a lot of projects lined up for us after this movie. We are always together and this gives us more opportunities to get to know each other. Based on how I know Seth now, it\u2019s not difficult to fall for him, but as he said, love is not our priority at the moment. There\u2019s a right time for it.\u201dFrancine and Seth were also asked to share their reactions to comments comparing them to the popular tandem of Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla or \u201cKathNiel.\u201d Kathryn and Daniel started dating a year after their love team was formed in 2011, and broke up in 2023.\u201cIf you say that our love team is \u2018the next KathNiel,\u2019 this implies that we will also have to go through a similar journey. Seth and I agreed that we want to be known based on our own merits, as FranSeth. Personally, I feel pressured by the fact that they see KathNiel in us,\u201d said Francine.Seth confessed that the idea actually makes him nervous. \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t meet people\u2019s expectations? We don\u2019t want to be KathNiel. I will not become another Daniel. That\u2019s impossible,\u201d he insisted.\u201cI guess in terms of the success they\u2019ve achieved as a team\u2014they made a lot of hit movies\u2014we want to achieve that, too. Workwise, what KathNiel has accomplished is no joke. The two contributed so much to this industry through their talent as actors, while Francine and I are still so new. If people expect FranSeth to reach the same level of success that KathNiel has achieved, then this means Francine and I should also prepare for a long and difficult journey,\u201d he pointed out.Francine, however, pleaded to KathNiel supporters not to take Seth\u2019s comment negatively. \u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong. We\u2019re friends with KathNiel. Ate Kath and I always greet each other. She\u2019s very kind, and so is Kuya DJ (Daniel\u2019s nickname). We just want to make it clear that we are not here to replace KathNiel,\u201d she declared.The two are scheduled to shoot their first big-screen project starting May 8. The film is written and directed by Cris B. Aquino (\u201cWrite About Love\u201d).Francine cited the biggest difference between working on a movie compared to a television series, something which she and Seth are used to doing.\u201cYou are less likely to commit a mistake when doing a film because you are able to track what you have filmed so far and which direction you\u2019re heading. Scripts for TV shows are often revised. Sometimes, you will be made to do a story plot again and again, only for it to be removed later on,\u201d she observed. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m both excited and nervous to start shooting. I also feel that it\u2019s been a while since I last acted in a movie. Everything that we will be doing here will feel new to me.\u201dIn \u201cMy Future You,\u201d a strange comet connects two timelines, 15 years apart, making Karen (Francine) and Lex (Seth) connect through a dating app. As they discover that they live in different years, they try to change the past to have a better future, but every change seems to lead to undesirable effects.When asked to share her views on finding true love through dating apps, Francine said she does think of herself credible enough to publicly express an opinion on it since she has not tried it herself.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m not the right person to answer the question. I\u2019d like to believe that there\u2019s forever in dating apps because I have friends and relatives who have found romantic partners through dating apps. They\u2019re still together up to now,\u201d she began.\u201cFor me, it doesn\u2019t matter how you find love, as long as you\u2019re happy and don\u2019t hurt other people in the process\u2014just go for it. While I believe there\u2019s true love in dating apps, I also think you can find it in family, friends and within yourself. It just depends on how you define it.\u201dSeth hasn\u2019t tried finding a partner through dating apps, \u201ceven though I also know of people who have,\u201d the actor told reporters. He then turned to Francine, and said: \u201cI have no intention of trying it.\u201dThe film, first conceptualized four years ago, also features Christian Vazquez, Almira Muhlach, Peewee O\u2019Hara, Bodjie Pascua, Mosang and Vance Larena.",

(Photo By Winslow Townson/Getty Images)BOSTON \u2014 One of the things Celtics forward Jaylen Brown remembers about his time inside the NBA Florida bubble in 2020 during the pandemic was his random sightings of Donovan Mitchell.Mitchell, then with the Utah Jazz, seemed to pop up in the common spaces of the bubble at the same time as Brown. It led to humorous fodder on social media between the pair and helped form a friendship between the young stars that continues today.But none of that is on Brown\u2019s mind this week as the East\u2019s top-seeded Celtics prepare to open their second-round series with Mitchell\u2019s Cleveland Cavaliers.\u201cAin\u2019t no friends in the playoffs,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to get ready to play. That\u2019s all I have to say on that.\u201dMitchell, who also calls Boston All-Star Jayson Tatum a friend, said he stopped talking to them when the bracket was finalized.\u201cIt\u2019s all competition and I expect nothing but the best from them and vice versa,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we got to go out there and take care of business in a hostile environment. \u2026 It\u2019s going to be fun. And I\u2019m excited.\u201dAfter dispatching the Miami Heat in five games in the first round, Boston will open Game 1 of its series with Cleveland on Tuesday night as heavy favorites, according to BetMGM.The Celtics will be getting a Cavaliers team playing on just a day\u2019s rest following a Game 7 win over Orlando in which they rallied from an 18-point deficit to advance.That game saw Mitchell score 39 points, boosting his scoring average to 28.7 points this postseason. It includes a 50-point performance in Game 6 against the Magic. After not seeing Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler in the opening round, Mitchell will be the first dynamic scorer Boston has faced this postseason.Cleveland\u2019s resiliency came on the heels of a regular season that saw the Cavaliers have a 23-5 stretch before the All-Star break before finishing the season 12-17. It featured a swath of injuries, including a nagging left knee issue for Mitchell. Starting center and defensive anchor Jarrett Allen also missed the final three games of the Magic series with a painful rib injury.Before getting hurt, Allen had been arguably Cleveland\u2019s steadiest and most durable player since November. He missed five games to open the year before playing in 77 straight while averaging a career-high 16.5 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.7 assists.Allen is questionable for Game 1, with reserve big man Dean Wade ruled out with a sprained right knee.Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff believes he saw his team\u2019s true identity during their Game 7 win over Orlando.\u201cThis group in particular has been through so much this year, a group who\u2019s been left for dead multiple times by a lot of people this year,\u201d he said. \u201cFor them to come together in this moment and figure it out, it\u2019s more about the group than me. We\u2019re most proud of that, but we\u2019re not done.\u201dFor the Celtics, 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis is also out for the series opener as he continues to rehab from the strained right calf that caused him to miss the finale of the Heat series.While Allen seems likely to return at some point in this series, Porzingis could be out most, if not all, of this round.Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said his team is ready to adjust as needed, just like it did to close out Miami.\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter what situation we\u2019re in, what matters is making sure we\u2019re ready to play,\u201d Mazzulla said.This will be the first meeting between the teams since Cleveland outlasted Boston in the 2018 Eastern Conference finals to secure their fourth straight Finals. The Cavalierss won Game 7 of that series at the Garden, led by LeBron James\u2019 35 points.This will be the ninth time the teams have met in the playoffs and fourth since 2015.The 2018 meeting was Brown\u2019s second career playoff run and the first for Tatum.Cleveland was the hunted team in the East then. Now the table\u2019s been turned.\u201cThat was a long time ago. 2018? Sheesh,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve come a long way. Obviously, that was a great experience and journey being able to play in the playoffs. At that time they had LeBron. It still stings a little bit that we lost in the end in Game 7. I\u2019ll make sure this series is a little different.\u201dCleveland hasn\u2019t traveled well in the playoffs the past two years, losing all five road games by an average 19.4 points \u2013 and Boston won\u2019t be rolling out the welcome mat.The Cavaliers were clobbered in Game 1 at Orlando, losing by 38 points, the most lopsided loss in team playoff history. They got beat by 23 in Game 2 before keeping it relatively close and losing Game 3 by just 7.The team\u2019s road issues extend to the regular season as Cleveland dropped seven of its last eight in the regular season away from home.The Cavs lost their two games in Boston \u2014 in a three-night span \u2014 in December.It turned out to be a painful short stay as Darius Garland suffered a broken jaw in the Dec. 14 game when he bumped into Porzingis on a drive to the basket.",

The sari-sari store can sell anywhere and that brings us into the digital space. Even what we referred to as nano enterprises. I\u2019m talking about the shoeshine boy, the mechanic who has had jobs,\u201d he said, citing examples of how the NFB can narrow the \u201cdigital divide.\u201dTo be implemented under the National Broadband Program of the Department of Information and Communications Technology, the first phase of the NFB will cover 1,245 kilometers from Laoag City in Ilocos Norte to Quezon City.It will be composed of 28 nodes and, with the completion of the next five phases by 2026, is expected to increase the internet penetration rate in the country from the current 33 percent to 65 percent, or 70 million out of 115 million Filipinos.With an initial 600 gigabits per second optical spectrum capacity, the NFB Phase 1 will extend a digital lifeline to more than 3,000 free Wi-Fi sites, translating to fast internet access to around 750,000 beneficiaries in Ilocos Norte, Central Luzon and Metro Manila.\u201c[It\u2019s a] very big push to bring MSMEs into the digital space\u201d and \u201cguarantee the people\u2019s enjoyment of the internet as a basic human right,\u201d the President added during the launch held at Sofitel Philippine Plaza Hotel in Pasay City.Aside from giving the local economy a boost, the NFB will also serve the needs of government agencies and the communities on its path, including 14 provinces in northern and Central Luzon, two national government data centers, and four ecozones, he added.The first phase can improve the efficiency of 346 national and local government offices connected to the Government Network and result in savings of up to more than P145 million every year. \u2014Julie M.

    "content": "LOS ANGELES\u2014It was December 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when \u201cMs James,\u201d a public school teacher in a small rural Southern town, realized that her virtual students were not watching the grammar lessons she assigned them. That is, until she posted them on TikTok.Everything changed when she learned about the social media platform and created her profile as @iamthatenglishteacher.\u201cIn a day, I had 1,000 followers, in a week I had 10,000, and in six weeks I had 100,000 followers,\u201d she told Reuters.\u201cWithin six months, I had a million and a half,\u201d added the teacher of 15 years, who asked not to use her full name for privacy.Now, she has 5.8 million followers on TikTok, but her educational content now faces a threat.The US House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill last week that will give TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the US assets of the short-video app, or face a ban. It\u2019s the greatest threat since the Trump administration to the app, and to the content creators who reach wide audiences and often earn their living on it.\u201cWhen you talk about the ban, you are talking about taking access to high-quality educational videos away from people who have used it to enhance their education,\u201d Ms James said.While her TikTok lessons are used by students ranging from elementary school to college, most of her followers are English as a second language students from the Philippines as well as homeschooled students.From videos on subject-verb agreement to vocabulary, Ms James believes that her legacy is to help the world through education and fears a ban would be detrimental.\u201cI think that TikTok is a wealth of knowledge,\u201d NaomiHearts, a content creator known by her 1.1 million followers for her TikTok videos about fatphobia and trans Chicana identity, told Reuters.She also fears that the ban will silence diverse, informative content, including her own.However, University of Southern California (USC) professor Karen North warns her students that personal data is in danger on TikTok.\u201cMy concern with TikTok is less about what information is provided or manipulated or whether it\u2019s skewed toward one message or another,\u201d North, the founder and former director of USC Annenberg\u2019s Digital Social Media program told Reuters.\u201cIt\u2019s more toward what kind of personal information are people voluntarily giving up to an entity that does not have the same standards for privacy that we (the United States) do. That\u2019s the big issue with TikTok,\u201d she added.North, a former White House employee for the Clinton administration at Capitol Hill, worries the Chinese company\u2019s use of functions like facial recognition and location tracking creates threats that outweigh the engaging benefits of the app, including in academia.Content creator Dr. Anthony Youn, known for his educational TikTok videos exploring his profession as a plastic surgeon, believes the ban would have significant drawbacks on information accessibility.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge segment of TikTok where you get your news, so it\u2019s about being educated,\u201d Dr. Youn, who has 8.4 million followers, told Reuters.Similarly, NaomiHearts feels the ban is less about protecting data, as other apps also collect personal information, and more about denying consumers informative content.",
